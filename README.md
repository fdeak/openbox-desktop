# openbox-desktop

Basic install and config for a complete openbox-based desktop

- plans 
  - only use the standard repos
  - use debian (centos based setup may be tested later)
  - provide an install script to install the necessary packages
  - provide config files to complete the desktop

- lot of things are stolen from bunsenlabs linux
  - differences from bunsen
    - lxsession-logout instead of bl-exit
    - try not to use/create external repos
    - use tint2config instead of editing a config file

TODO
- post install setup, such as 
  - setting up gtk theme
  - power manager setup
  - merge new configs on existing setups
  - auto-config tint2 for multiple monitors
  
- complete the openbox menu for all config items (e.g arandr)

- switch off bluetooth by default

- check what (else) can be stolen from bunsenlabs-linux
