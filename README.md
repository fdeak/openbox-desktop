# openbox-desktop

Basic install and config for a complete openbox-based desktop


TODO
- post install setup, such as 
  - gtk theme
  - power manager setup
  - tint2 on multiple monitors
  
- complete the openbox menu for all config items (e.g arandr)

- switch off bluetooth by default

- check what (else) can be stolen from bunsenlabs-linux
